    <h2 class="Hmainp">Why soft skills are important?</h2>
    <p class="p1" id="whatever">Most interactions with other people require some level of soft skills.
         At a company you might be negotiating to win a new contract, presenting your new idea to colleagues, networking for a new job, and so on. 
         We use soft skills everyday at work and developing these soft skills will help you win more business and accelerate your career progression.</p>
